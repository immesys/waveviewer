# Privacy policy

## TL;DR

1) I am not a lawyer
2) Assume this app logs absolutely every single piece of information available on your device

## Explanation

Waveviewer in and of itself does not transmit any information off the device, other than the public key of your entity during the ragent connection. However, any wavelet you open could do anything it wants. So take care to only open applications on namespaces that you trust.
